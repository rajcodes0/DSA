 1️⃣ Binary (Basics)
🔹 What is Binary?
Binary uses **only 2 digits**:

0 and 1

Each position is a **power of 2**.

128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1

 Example

1011₂
= 8 + 2 + 1
= 11₁₀

🔹 Decimal → Binary (fast way)

Take number → keep dividing by 2 → write remainders → reverse.

Example: `10`

```
10 / 2 = 5  r 0
5  / 2 = 2  r 1
2  / 2 = 1  r 0
1  / 2 = 0  r 1
```

➡ Binary = **1010**

Binary table feels hard only because people try to **memorize** it.
You don’t need that. You need **patterns**.

I’ll show you the **only practical way** to learn it fast.

## 🔢 What is a Binary Table?

It’s just **powers of 2**.

| Power | Value |
| ----- | ----- |
| 2⁰    | 1     |
| 2¹    | 2     |
| 2²    | 4     |
| 2³    | 8     |
| 2⁴    | 16    |
| 2⁵    | 32    |
| 2⁶    | 64    |
| 2⁷    | 128   |
| 2⁸    | 256   |
| 2⁹    | 512   |
| 2¹⁰   | 1024  |

That’s it. No magic.

---

## 🧠 Golden Rule (MOST IMPORTANT)

> **Each next value = previous × 2**

Example:

```
1 → 2 → 4 → 8 → 16 → 32 → 64 → 128
```

If you know **one**, you know all.

---

## 🔥 Learn using Left Shift (programmer trick)

In binary:

```
1 << 0 = 1
1 << 1 = 2
1 << 2 = 4
1 << 3 = 8
1 << 4 = 16
```

So:

```
2ⁿ = 1 << n
```

This is why binary is EASY for coders.

---

## 👀 Visual way (binary positions)

```
128  64  32  16  8  4  2  1
 1    0    1    0   1  0  0  1
```

👉 Just add the columns where `1` exists.

Example:

10101001₂
= 128 + 32 + 8 + 1
= 16

 2️⃣ Complement (VERY IMPORTANT)

🔹 1’s Complement

Just **flip bits**.

```
0 → 1
1 → 0
```

Example:

```
1010 → 0101
```

---

## 🔹 2’s Complement (used in computers)

### Rule:
2’s complement = (1’s complement) + 1
Example:

Number: 5
Binary: 0101

1’s complement → 1010
Add 1           → 1011
➡ `1011` represents **-5**
🔥 This is how **negative numbers** are stored.
🧠 Shortcut

~n  =  -(n + 1)

Example:

~5 = -6
In a computer, the number 5 is stored as a series of bits. For simplicity, let's look at it in an 8-bit format:Decimal 5 in binary is: 00000101When we apply NOT (~), every bit flips: 11111010In the Two's Complement system (which C++ uses), any binary number starting with a 1 is negative. The specific pattern 11111010 represents -6.🔍 Seeing the PatternLet's look at a few examples side-by-side to see if we can spot the "off-by-one" relationship:

Decimaln,   Binary n,     Flipped Bits (~n),       Resulting Decimal
0,          00000000,         11111111                 ,-1
1,          00000001          ,11111110,                 -2
2,          00000010,         11111101,                  -3

 3️⃣ Set Bits (Count of 1s)

🔹 What are Set Bits?

Bits that are **1**.

Example:

```
101101
Set bits = 4
```

---

 🔹 Best Trick (DSA GOLD)

```cpp
while(n > 0) {
    n = n & (n - 1);
    count++;
}
```

Each step removes **one set bit**.

### Example:

```
n = 12 (1100)
n-1 = 11 (1011)
n&(n-1) = 1000
```

---

## 🔹 Power of 2 Check

Only ONE set bit.

cpp
n & (n - 1) == 0



# 4️⃣ Binary (Bitwise) Operators

## 🔹 AND (`&`)

```
1 & 1 = 1
else  = 0
```

Example:

```
5 & 3
101
011
---
001 → 1
```

Used for:

* Checking even/odd
* Masking bits

---

## 🔹 OR (`|`)

```
1 | 0 = 1
0 | 1 = 1
```

Example:

```
5 | 3
101
011
---
111 → 7
```

---

## 🔹 XOR (`^`)

```
Same → 0
Different → 1
```

Example:

```
5 ^ 3
101
011
---
110 → 6
```

🔥 Special properties:

```
x ^ x = 0
x ^ 0 = x
```

Used in:

* Swapping numbers
* Finding unique element

---

## 🔹 NOT (`~`)

Flips all bits.

```
~5 = -6
```

Because:

```
~n = -(n+1)
```

---

## 🔹 Left Shift (`<<`)

Shifts left → **multiply by 2**

```
n << k = n × 2ᵏ
```

Example:

```
5 << 1 = 10
5 << 2 = 20
```

---

## 🔹 Right Shift (`>>`)

Shifts right → **divide by 2**

```
n >> 1 = n / 2
```

Example:

```
10 >> 1 = 5
```
